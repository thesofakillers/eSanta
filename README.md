Originally made for my University's Department of Computer Science's course _Programming Paradigms_ under the sub-module _Web Programming_, as part of the coursework in 2018/2019.

This project aims to construct a dynamic website of any application domain utilizing [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). The website includes as a minimum the notion of people and at least one other object. The website is to consist in static [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) pages loading dynamic [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) content via [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)). The client-side should be responsive to resizing through a the use of a framework such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). The server-side is to utilize a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API to provide JSON content. The website should be deployed both locally and in the cloud.

Testing can be achieved with
```
npm test
```

The web deployment link is [https://siliconsanta.herokuapp.com/](https://siliconsanta.herokuapp.com/).
